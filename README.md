## Troubleshooting

### Applet not showing music info
- Ensure your music player supports MPRIS
- Check that the player is actually playing music
- Restart the music player and the applet

### No album artwork
- Album artwork depends on the music player providing image URLs
- Some players may not provide artwork through MPRIS
- Local files may not have embedded artwork

### Mouse shortcuts not working
- Ensure you're hovering directly over the applet icon
- Check that no other application is intercepting mouse events

## Building Requirements

The following system packages are required for building:

- `libdbus-1-dev` (for MPRIS communication)
- `pkg-config` (for dependency detection)
- `libssl-dev` (for HTTPS requests)

Install on Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install libdbus-1-dev pkg-config libssl-dev
```

Install on Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install dbus-devel pkgconfig openssl-devel
```
